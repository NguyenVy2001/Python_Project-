# 📊 Product Sales and Price Dynamics Analysis

This project focuses on **analyzing product sales** in relation to changes in **pricing over time**. The primary goal is to calculate the **final sale price** of products by comparing the timing of sales against price updates, ensuring that each sale reflects the **correct price** based on when the order was placed.

This project is especially valuable for businesses that **frequently update their prices** and want to understand how these changes impact **sales** and **revenue** over time.

## 🎯 **Project Focus**
- 🔄 **Price Dynamics**: This project examines how changes in product prices affect sales revenue, specifically determining which price (old or new) should apply to each sale.
- 🕒 **Temporal Analysis**: A time-based analysis is performed, comparing the timestamp of sales orders to price update times, ensuring that each sale reflects the price in effect at the time of the order.
